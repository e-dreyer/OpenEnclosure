# Firmware

This is folder contains the `FIRMWARE.bin` file currently installed on the printer. This file can be written to an `SD card` and be used to flash the printer with `Klipper`. It is however important to note that certain updates to `Klipper` on the `Raspberry Pi` might require a new `FIRMWARE.bin` file to be created for the printer, depending on the changelog.
